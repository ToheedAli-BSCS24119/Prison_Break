Probability:
          The extent to which an event is likely to occur, measured by the ratio of the favourable cases to the whole number of cases possible.

Its formula is:
 P=f/N
where N is the total number of cases and f is the number of favourable cases

Description:
           Probability tells us about possibility of happening of any event. Its applications are in every field.
The prediction of winning of any cricket team we see in matches is actually the probability. It has applications in sports, weather prediction, medicine, finance and economics and also in criminology. 

In our prison break project. We will use probability to calculate our risk factor during the escape and the success percentage finding.
Continuening from the combinatorics we have 1024 total paths of anything. Now if we want to find the probability of the ways in which prisoners succeed we just assume because the whole calculation is simply not possible.

With 3 guards and a watch tower around we can assume that the prisoners can escape about 3 in 100 times.
so,
=1024*3/100=30.72

hence about 31 times of 1024 tries.The prisoners succeed in breaking while about 993 the prisoners are caught or are unable to escape
