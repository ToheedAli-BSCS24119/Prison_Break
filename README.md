# Graph Theory
1. Mapping the Prison: We can create a map (a graph) where rooms and hallways are connected like dots (nodes) and lines (edges). This makes it easier to plan possible routes to escape.​
2. Finding the Best Path: We can use math to find the shortest or safest way out, avoiding areas with guards or cameras.​
