First of all we select the topic PRISON BREAK becausse it was a unique topic, and we could learn more different things and dive inside of Discrete Mathematics. 
We talked to Saleha and decided to divide our topic into sub topics so each topic can relate with Discrete Mathematics.
Our 4 Sub topics are
1. Graph Theory
2. Logics
3. Permutation and Combination
4. Set Theory

Each member of the group was assigned a sub topic on which he could work
Graph theory is assigned to Toheed and Hussnain
Logics are assigned to Ibraheem
Permutation and Combination are assigned to Taha
and Set Theory is assigned to Bilawal

The next day, Taha came to Hussnain and me and said that we donâ€™t have a prison layout on which he can apply logic to break it.

So, Hussnain and I studied graph theory and its types for about a week and a half. We also took help from ChatGPT and YouTube to enhance our understanding. 
Afterward, we shared our study materials with each other. 
Based on our research, we created a prison layout consisting of cells, prisoners, guards, an entrance, an exit, and a watchtower. 
We give that prison layout to other members to break it using Sets, Logics etc.
Our other members are currently working on their parts but we are also helping them with their part of the work, 
its not just thst we are working on our part but also helping each other out so everybody understands everything and at the end of the day we could 
gain a lot of knowledge of discrest maths with the help of this project 

Today, we work on the set theory and logics 
through the set theory we discribes the set if Location, Time, Prisoners, Guards etc
and through the logics and proposition we make possible wayss to break the prison
