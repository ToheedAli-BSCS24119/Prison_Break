# Contribution 
We divided our work in the following manner:
1. Graph Theory: Toheed Ali
2. Game Theory: Hassnain Javiad
3. Combination and Permutation: Taha Qureshi
4. Logic and Boolean algebra​: M.Ibraheem Tahir
5. Probability: Bilawal Nouman
# Graph Theory
1. Mapping the Prison: We can create a map (a graph) where rooms and hallways are connected like dots (nodes) and lines (edges). This makes it easier to plan possible routes to escape.​
2. Finding the Best Path: We can use math to find the shortest or safest way out, avoiding areas with guards or cameras.​
