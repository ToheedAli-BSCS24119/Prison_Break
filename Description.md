# Agenda
1. Graph Theory​
2. Combination and Permutations ​
3. Logic and Boolean algebra​
4. Game theory​
5. Probability​
# Contribution 
We divided our work in the following manner:
1. Graph Theory: Toheed Ali
2. Game Theory: Hassnain Javiad
3. Combination and Permutation: Taha Qureshi
4. Logic and Boolean algebra​: M.Ibraheem Tahir
5. Probability: Bilawal Nouman
# Graph Theory
1. Mapping the Prison: We can create a map (a graph) where rooms and hallways are connected like dots (nodes) and lines (edges). This makes it easier to plan possible routes to escape.​
2. Finding the Best Path: We can use math to find the shortest or safest way out, avoiding areas with guards or cameras.​
# Combinations and Permutations
1. Planning Resources: If prisoners have limited resources or people, we can calculate different ways to use them most effectively.
2. Creating Escape Plans: We can look at different sequences of actions and find the one that's most likely to succeed.
# Logic and Boolean Algebra
1. Understanding Security Systems: By using logic, we can figure out how alarms and sensors work and look for weaknesses.​
2. Decision Trees: We can map out each choice, like a tree, showing what might happen after each decision to pick the best options.​
