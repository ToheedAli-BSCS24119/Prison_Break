Combinatorics:

Combinations and permutations help calculate the different ways of arranging or selecting escape routes and movements, taking order and grouping into account. In "Prison Break," they allow us to examine multiple possible sequences of moves or select the optimal paths considering various conditions. For example, by calculating permutations of movements, we can simulate different escape routes and assess their success probabilities. This combinatorial approach provides a structured way to explore all possible actions for effective escape planning.

A BIT MORE EXPLANATION:
 Formula for permutations: P(n,r)=n!/(n-r)!
 Where: • n= total number of objects, • r = number of objects selected, • ! represents factorial
 (e.g., 5!=5×4×3×2×15! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 times=5×4×3×2×1).
 Formula for combinations: C(n,r)=n!/r!(n-r)!
Where: • n = total number of objects, • r = number of objects selected.
 suppose i have 1 prisoner that will escape and 3 escape routes then combination will be better to use hence I have C(3,1)=3!/1!(3-1)! C(3,1)=3
 HENCE 3 POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF ESCAPE NOW I WILL USE MORE ROUTES AND GUARDS AND WALLS AND TRAPS ETC ETC



UPDATE 3:


We have actually 3 prisoners and each one can escape alone or with any other member or all the 3 members can escape together because the prisons are joined as indicated by our tentative map design

here the total arrangements by which the prisoners can escape is find by the permutations logics. We have 3 prisoners and each prisoner can escape alone w=or with any other member. i.e each 1 2 3 prisoner can escape without each other or other 2 members can escape together or all 3 can escape all together. Its a very fun process to calculate it .

We use the simple permutation formulas for this word
There are 7 ways the prisoners can escape 
in combination we use
3C3 + 3C2 + 3C1 = 1 + 3 + 3
Hence 7 possible arrangements in which the members can escape 
This is only the starting of combinatorics here

UPDATE 4:
According to the map, we have 3 prisoners with 2 guards but also a single watchtower that watches 
For combinatorics we must know the guards movements and also the watchtower one.
Guard 1 can move from its rest position to common room and cell2.
similarly guard 2 can move to common room and exit.
while the watch tower can see towards ENTER or EXIT but only one at a time

hence the states are 2 for guards and 2 for the tower.
Hence total configurations of guards movements=2*2*2 = 8

UPDATE 5:
There are 2 escape routes. The enter is also the exit but changed names while the exit is obviously the exit.
To calculate the total no of outcomes we can use the product rule .It is a very complicated problem.
Using discrete math we know that 8 total guard movements are present. We have to multiply it with something to actually find the total outcomes.
Now we know that any prisoner total movement probability of any member is 12
According to my observations 
Outcomes= Guards movement * arrangements of prisoners * total movement probability of any member
outcomes= 8 * 7 * 12
=672
this is just the tentative not the final answer
