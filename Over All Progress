First of all we select the topic PRISON BREAK becausse it was a unique topic, and we could learn more different things and depp inside of Discrete Mathematics. 
We talked to Saleha and decided to divide our topic into sub topics so each topic can relate with Discrete Mathematics.
Our 4 Sub topics are
1. Graph Theory
2. Logics
3. Permutation and Combination
4. Set Theory

Each member of the group was assigned a sub topic on which he could work
