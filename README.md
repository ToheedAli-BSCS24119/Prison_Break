# Graph Theory
1. Mapping the Prison: We can create a map (a graph) where rooms and hallways are connected like dots (nodes) and lines (edges). This makes it easier to plan possible routes to escape.​
2. Finding the Best Path: We can use math to find the shortest or safest way out, avoiding areas with guards or cameras.​
# Breadth-First Search (BFS) 
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm that explores nodes in a graph layer by layer, starting from a given node. It visits all neighboring nodes before moving to the next level, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs. BFS uses a queue to track nodes and is ideal for finding the shortest path in simple, evenly weighted environments like grids or mazes.
