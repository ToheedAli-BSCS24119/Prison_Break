My name is M.Ibraheem Tahir. I have been assigned the sub-topic "Logics" in our Project of Prison Break.
Currently, accaording to our Prison Layout, we have 3 prisinors, 2 guards, and 1 watchtower in which there is also 1 guard.
Currently, I am working on creating different logics, on how our prisinors can escape from the prison without being detected by any of the guards.
